- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: 
To be honest, as much as the IT world fascinates me, if I weren’t competitive and determined, I might have given up a long time ago. The field I’ve chosen to dive into is incredibly under-documented, especially for Francophones like me. Fortunately, I have a solid foundation in English, which has been a huge advantage. But I know that’s not the case for everyone, and I can only imagine how frustrating it must be.  

That’s why I’m committed to supporting and guiding others who find themselves in a similar situation. At the same time, I hope to learn from those who have already overcome these challenges and taken these steps.  

In short: MeOps, at your service.
